# About me

Hi, my name's Rodrigo ðŸ™‚

I'm 17. I study at IFSUL (High school and electronics technician course) in the morning and work as a Frontend developer at Nodo Digital in the afternoon.

I do love music, innovation, technology, thinking out of the box, and group work. Working through it all is just amazing.


# What do I do?

I (love to) help people solve their problems with all types of technology.


# What technologies do I have experiencied through these years of developer?

> Those paragraphs above could change very often since I'm always learning something new

I have been developing web and mobile applications since 2017. Trough these years, I have been mainly working with HTML5, CSS3, and Javascript (EcmaScript 6 and so on) and it majors frameworks (mostly React and React Native, but also Node, Jquery, Vue, TypeScript,  Next, Nuxt, Nest, among others).

I also have some experience (but never worked for real) with MongoDB, MySQL, C, C#, C++, Java, Python, Godot, Unity, GDScript, Figma, Skecth and others technologies/tools.


# This Project

This is my website made to look like an old terminal.

Besides I really liked this visual, I think this terminal style could truly pass what I love to do and then a little bit about who I am.

I hope you like it ðŸ˜„
