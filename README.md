# About me

Hi, my name's Rodrigo. =)

I'm 17. I study at IFSUL (High school and electronics technician course) in the morning and work as a Frontend developer at Nodo Digital in the afternoon.

I've already developed web (and mobile) applications with VueJs, React Native, TypeScript, and many other technologies to find or/and solve a problem with this beautiful thing called logic.

I particularly love music, innovation, technology, thinking out of the box, and group work, so working through it all is just amazing.

# This Project

This is my website made to look like an old terminal.

Besides I really liked this visual, I think this terminal style could truly pass what I love to do and then a little bit about who I am.

What do I love to do?

To help peolpe solve their problems with technology =)
